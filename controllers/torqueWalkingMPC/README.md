## Module description

This module implements a torque control balancing and walking strategy. It computes the joint torques that minimize the error between the actual and a desired joint dynamics. The optimization procedure is subject to a set of equality and inequality contraints, and it is solved by means of a Quadratic Programming solver.

For walking demo, CoM and joint references are provided by an external module implementing an MPC-LIP algorithm. For more information, **check this [documentation](https://github.com/loc2/component_wholebody-teleoperation/blob/master/doc/how_to_run_torqueWalking_simulations.md)**.

### Compatibility

The repository contains the Simulink model `torqueWalkingMPC.mdl`, which is generated by using Matlab R2016b.

### Supported robots

Currently, supported robots are: `iCubGenova04`, `iCubGenova02`, `icubGazeboSim`, `iCubGazeboV2_5`.

## Module details

### Configuration file

At start, the module calls the initialization file initTorqueWalkingMPC.m. Once opened, this file contains some configuration variables. Please follow the instruction inside this script to properly configure your simulation.

### Robot and demo specific configurations

The gains and references for a specific robot (specified by the variable YARP_ROBOT_NAME) or a specific demo can be found in the folder `app/robots/YARP_ROBOT_NAME`.
