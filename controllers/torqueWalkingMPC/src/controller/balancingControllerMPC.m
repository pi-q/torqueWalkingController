% BALANCINGCONTROLLERMPC this function impements a control strategy for 
%                        balancing a constrained floating base system.
%
% IMPLEMENTATION: the robot is modeled as a floating base system:
%
%                     M(q)*nuDot + h(q,nu) = J_c(q)^T*f + S*tau  [1]
%
%                 subject to a set of holonomic constraints:
%
%                     J_c(q)*nuDot + J_cDot_nu = 0.  [2]
%
%                 For controlling the robot, a set of tasks in the
%                 Cartesian space is defined. In particular:
%                
%                 - position of the robot CoM;
%                 - orientation of a link specified by the user;
%                 - position and orientation of the swinging foot (ONE FOOT
%                   BALANCING ONLY).
%
%                 It is possible to relate the state accelerations and the
%                 cartesian accelerations through forward kinematics:
%
%                     J_t(q)*nuDot + J_tDot_nu = acc_t  [3]
%
%                 Then, we define as control input of eq. [1] both the 
%                 contact forces f and the joint torques tau. Eq. [1] becomes:
%
%                     M(q)*nuDot + h(q,nu) = B(q)*u  [4]
%
%                 where B(q) = [J(q)^T S]. We then define a postural task
%                 for controlling the joint space dynamics as follows:
%
%                     sDDot^* = sDDot_des -Kp*(s-s_des) -Kd*(sDot-sDot_des) [5].
%
%                 Finally, the whole control architecture can be rewritten
%                 as a constrained quadratic optimization. In fact, one may
%                 think of finding u that minimizes the error between
%                 sDDot and sDDot^* while satisfying [2]-[3], plus the 
%                 friction cones and unilateral constraints on the contact 
%                 forces. Furthermore, we aim at minimizing also the torques
%                 necessary for achieving the required task. In short:
%
%                     min_u |sDDot(u)-sDDot^* + K_t*tau|^2
% 
%                         s.t.  C*f < b
%                               J_c(q)*nuDot + J_cDot_nu = 0
%                               J_t(q)*nuDot + J_tDot_nu = acc_t

    % inertial frame, we have to update the constraint matrix according to
    % the transformation w_R_l_sole, i.e.
