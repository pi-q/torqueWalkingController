    %% QP PARAMETERS FOR TWO FEET STANDING
    % In the case the robot stands on two feet/legs, the control objective is 
    % the minimization of the joint torques through the redundancy of the 
    % contact forces. By direct calculations one shows that the joint
    % torques take the following form:
    %
    % 0) tau = tauModel + Sigma*f_HDot + SigmaNA*f0
    %
    % where f0 is the redundancy of the contact wrenches. Then, the problem
    % is defined as follows:
    %
    % 1) f0  = argmin |tau(f0)|^2
    %          s.t.
    %          ConstraintsMatrixQP2Contacts*f0 < bVectorConstraintsQp2Contacts
    %
    % Update constraint matrices. The constraint matrix for the inequality
    % constraints in the problem 1) is built up starting from the constraint
    % matrix associated with each single contact. More precisely, the contact
    % wrench associated with the left contact (resp. right contact) is subject to
    % the following constraint:
    %
    % constraintMatrixLeftContact*l_sole_f_L < bVectorConstraints
    %
    % In this case, however, f_L is expressed w.r.t. the frame l_contact,
    % which is solidal to the left contact. Since the controller uses contact
    % wrenches expressed w.r.t. a frame whose orientation is that of the
    % inertial frame, we have to update the constraint matrix according to
    % the transformation w_R_l_contact, i.e.
    %
    % constraintMatrixLeftContact = ConstraintsMatrix*w_R_l_contact
