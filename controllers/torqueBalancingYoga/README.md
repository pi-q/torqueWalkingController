## Module description

This module implements a torque control balancing strategy. It computes the interaction forces at the feet in order to stabilise a desired centroidal dynamics, which implies the tracking of a desired center-of-mass trajectory. A cost function penalizing high joint torques - that generate the feet forces - is added to the control framework.

For details see [iCub whole-body control through force regulation on rigid non-coplanar contacts](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frobt.2015.00006/abstract)

### Compatibility

The repository contains the Simulink model `torqueBalancingYoga.mdl`, which is generated by using Matlab R2016b.

### Supported robots

Currently, supported robots are: `iCubGenova04`, `iCubGenova02`, `icubGazeboSim`, `iCubGazeboV2_5`.

## Module details

### Configuration file

At start, the module calls the initialization file initTorqueBalancingYoga.m. Once opened, this file contains some configuration variables. Please follow the instruction inside the script to properly configure your simulation.

### Robot and demo specific configurations

The gains and references for a specific robot (specified by the variable YARP_ROBOT_NAME) or a specific demo can be found in the folder `app/robots/YARP_ROBOT_NAME`.
