% COMPUTEQPHESSIANANDCONSTRAINTS computes Hessian matrix, gradient and
%                                constraints for integration based inverse 
%                                kinematics.
%
% IMPLEMENTATION: we assume to have a desired set of joint accelerations
%                 sDDot_star. We also assume to have a desired set of
%                 accelerations for a Cartesian task, namely acc_task_star.
%                 The objective is to find a set of state accelerations nuDot 
%                 which minimize the error (sDDot-sDDot_star), while subject 
%                 to the constraint that the task desired accelerations must 
%                 be achieved. The optimization procedure can be written as:
%
%                     nuDot = [nuDot_b; sDDot];
%
%                     nuDot = min(1/2*|(sDDot-sDDot_star) + nuDot_b|^2)
%
%                         s.t. J*nuDot + JDot_nu = acc_task_star                     
%
% USAGE: please note that this function has been designed for being inserted
